Ask yourself if Red State is for you. But keep it to yourself if you're in Red State.

Don't talk to me or do anything for me, bro. It looks like you have your hands full, living the high life in Red State.

Looking for more of God and less of the Red State's high life, bro? Why don't you go let the Red Priestess fulfill you?

Plenty of red apples for equally red Adams.

Have some red fruit. Go on. You deserve it.

Your life is yours to live, bro, even in Red State. If you can't let things go, get the fuck out of my life.

I mean it, you son of a fuck ass bitch.

Everything happens for a reason, you know. You want to be a successful person, you gotta be populist. You wanna be populist? Don't be a 
loser populist. You are what you eat, capische? Am I right or wrong here? Vespauche. Gulick. Don't forget. If you're going to wear a  
bow tie, wear a red bow tie. If you wear any other color of bow tie, you can't be seen in public with it.

I always struggle to understand why people want to be individuals. Everything is so dependent and interconnected. It's selfish and a sign 
of weakness to choose to be alone. It's clear evidence something is not right with the person, like they're hiding something, like they 
want to stick out from the crowd. And when the only crowds are populist crowds, well... you can guess who's the one lonely loser. The 
individual. Populists speak for themselves. Individuals can't speak up for anyone.

If you're struggling to do business, here's a reality check on what little chump change you have to offer. You can't separate yourself from the 
crowd. You can choose to surrender to corporate or you can risk being owned by the populist masses.

Confused about who you are underneath? Can't see the difference between conservative and liberal? Don't know what's right for you and what's 
right for your society? Don't think anymore. Be a populist. It's the only answer that will always fit. Just do it.
